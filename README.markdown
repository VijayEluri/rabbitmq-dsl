# RabbitMQ Groovy DSL

The Groovy DSL (Domain Specific Language) for RabbitMQ allows you to mix standard
Groovy code with a builder-style syntax for working with a RabbitMQ server. For
example, consider the following:

<code>
mq.exchange(name: "test", durable: false, autoDelete: true) {
  // Named, non-durable queue
  queue name: "test", routingKey: "test.key", {
    consume tag: "test", onmessage: {msg ->
      log.info(msg.bodyAsString)
    }
  }
}
</code>

This example uses the RabbitMQ DSL to:

1. Declares a non-durable, autodelete exchange named "test"
2. Declares a named, non-durable, autodelete queue named "test" and binds that queue
   to the enclosing exchange.
3. Creates a queueing consumer (tagged with "test") that executes the "onmessage"
   closure every time a message is received.
