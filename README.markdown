## Building

Clone the source code:

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/jbrisbin/rabbitmq-dsl.git</code></pre>

To build a JAR file of the command-line DSL runner:

<pre><code>cd rabbitmq-dsl
mvn package</code></pre>

There is a unit test that will run in the normal Maven build stage. Look in the
src/test/groovy/rabbitmq-test.g file to see the full text of the DSL test.

## RabbitMQ Groovy DSL

The Groovy DSL (Domain Specific Language) for RabbitMQ allows you to mix standard
Groovy code with a builder-style syntax for working with a RabbitMQ server. For
example, consider the following:

<pre><code>mq.exchange(name: "test", durable: false, autoDelete: true) {
  // Named, non-durable queue
  queue name: "test", routingKey: "test.key", {
    consume tag: "test", onmessage: {msg ->
      log.info(msg.bodyAsString)
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

#### This example uses the RabbitMQ DSL to:

1. Declares a non-durable, autodelete exchange named "test"
2. Declares a named, non-durable, autodelete queue named "test" and binds that queue
   to the enclosing exchange.
3. Creates a queueing consumer (tagged with "test") that executes the "onmessage"
   closure every time a message is received.

## Usage:

The Groovy DSL is intended to be used to create compact, self-documenting, RabbitMQ
code similar to what ActiveMQ users have with Camel. Nesting queues within exchanges
ensures that an exchange exists and that all queues are properly bound before your
Groovy code is actually run.

If you want an anonymous, server-generated queue name, set the "name" property to "null":

<pre><code>mq.exchange(name: "test", durable: false, autoDelete: true) {
  // Anonymous, non-durable queue
  queue name: null, routingKey: "test.key", {
    consume tag: "test", onmessage: {msg ->
      log.info(msg.bodyAsString)
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

To publish messages, use the "publish" node:

<pre><code> // Publish some messages
  queue routingKey: "test.key", {
    publish body: "this is a test"
  }</code></pre>

If you set the "body" property to a string, the builder will call .getBytes() on it and
set the body of the message to that. If you set the "body" property to a real byte
array (maybe you read in a file or posted a file, or something), it will blindly use
what you give it. If you want to pass a closure, you can do that too:

<pre><code>  queue routingKey: "test.key", {
    publish myHeaderValue: "customHeader", body: {msg, out ->
      msg.properties.contentType = "text/plain"
      out.write("these are test bytes".bytes)
    }
  }</code></pre>

The "msg" variable passed to your closure is actually a lightweight bean wrapper that puts
an instance of AMQP.BasicProperties ("properties"), an AMQP Envelope ("envelope"), and the
body ("body" and "bodyAsString") onto a single object, which makes the bean introspection in
Groovy happier.

If you want to run arbitrary Groovy code and access the RabbitMQ Channel object directly,
declare a closure like so:

<pre><code>mq {channel ->
  // Do channel-specific stuff here...
  channel.exchangeDelete("test.exchange")
}</code></pre>

#### Notes:

* Returning a non-null or "true" result from the closure specified on the "onmessage"
  property causes the consumer to keep listening for messages until the closure returns
  a false or &lt;NULL&gt; value.
